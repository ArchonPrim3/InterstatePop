Tracking interstate migration data within the U.S., the initial project for 2015 and 2019 can be found [here](https://archonprim3.github.io/InterstatePop/Interstate-Final-Revision-MARKDOWN.html).

If all goes well I will be presenting at the 98th annual conference for the [Western Economic Association International](https://weai.org/conferences/view/13/98th-Annual-Conference) in July. The focus of my paper is on international trade studying the effects NAFTA had on the Mexican agricultural and industrial sectors. [Here](https://archonprim3.github.io/InterstatePop/WEAI_WORKING_COPY-The_effects_of_NAFTA_on_the_Mexican_Agricultural_and_Industrial_Sectors-Miguel_Dominguez.docx) is a copy of my working paper that needs many improvements to create an adequate submission. Do note that the embedded charts are interactive if you enable editing, try filtering my data!
